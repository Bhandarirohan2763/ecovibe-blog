    <h2>Sustainable Fashion: Looking Good, Doing Good</h2>
    <p>Sustainable fashion in 2025 isn't just a trend—it's a movement. As fast fashion declines, people are embracing ethical alternatives like upcycled denim, bamboo loungewear, and slow-fashion brands that prioritize people and the planet.</p>
    <p>Look out for brands like <strong>Pangaia</strong>, <strong>Kotn</strong>, and <strong>Thought</strong>, which use organic fabrics and fair labor practices. Plus, secondhand marketplaces like Poshmark and ThredUp are booming among Gen Z and millennials.</p>

    <p>Top Tip: Decorate with plants—they purify the air and add instant calm. Also, brands like IKEA and The Citizenry are pushing eco-friendly lines in 2025 that are both chic and conscious.</p>

    <h2>Wellness & Lifestyle: Conscious Choices, Calm Mind</h2>
    <p>Mindful living is the new luxury. In 2025, wellness is deeply rooted in eco-conscious habits. People are prioritizing plant-based diets, digital detoxes, and regenerative travel—travel that actually heals the earth.</p>
    <p>Minimalism and slow living are in. It's not about doing more, but doing better. Think: morning yoga, zero-waste skincare, and nature-first choices. Wellness in 2025 means being well *with* the planet.</p>
